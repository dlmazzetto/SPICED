1. Extract data from MongoDB
- Connect to the database
- Query the data

2. Transform the data
- Sentiment Analysis (will see this in the afternoon)
- Possibly we could transform datatypes

3. Load it into Postgres
- Connect to postgres
- Insert Into postgres

'''
Right now the ETL job extracts the whole mongodb database in each run and appends it
to the tweets table in postgres.
This will cause a lot of duplicates in postgres.

Probably something we would want to do, is to only query the newest tweets from mongo
(or load all of the data but replace the tweets data in postgres)

- Usually the first option will be preferred. We call this an incremental load.
- There are situations in which you prefer a full load, for example if historical data
 can change.

How could we do that?
- you can filter the data in your query .find({condition})
- last five minutes (there is a timestamp in the tweets)
- findOne()
- find the last 100
- for the tweets that were extracted already, mark them as extracted .update() or .updateMany(); add 'extracted': 1
- query only for the ones that have not been extracted yet
